# Legal & Compliance Checklist (Romania + EU)

> This is a practical checklist to help you launch as a **marketplace / intermediary platform**.
> It is not legal advice; have a Romanian/EU lawyer review your final documents.

## Marketplace positioning
- Present the app as an **intermediary platform** connecting travelers with independent Guides/Hosts.
- Guides/Hosts are independent providers and are responsible for their own licenses, insurance, taxes.
- The platform does not act as a tour operator.

## Required documents (EN + RO)
- Terms & Conditions

## GDPR & privacy
- Identify data controller and contact.
- Explain data collected: identity, contact, booking data, payment metadata.
- Use Stripe as payment processor; do not store card data.
- Provide deletion/export request channel.

## Payments & taxes
- Use Stripe Connect Express so payouts go directly to providers.
- Platform keeps a clearly disclosed commission fee.
- Clarify VAT handling:
  - platform subscription fees may require VAT
  - provider services may require VAT depending on provider status

## Consumer protection
- Provide clear cancellation rules per listing.
- Provide dispute/contact process.
- Provide no-show policy.

## Provider compliance (RO)
- Collect SRL/PFA details + certificate of registration.

## Romania tourism constraints
