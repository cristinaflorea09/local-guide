# Commission & Subscription Model (draft)

This is a non-legal draft you can refine with a lawyer.

## Definitions
- **Traveler**: user who books.
- **Guide**: seller who provides tours.
- **Host**: seller who provides cultural experiences.

## Platform fee (commission)
- The platform charges a **service commission** on each paid booking.
- Commission is calculated on the booking **total price** (including taxes if collected by the platform) unless stated otherwise.

### Starter rates (example)
- Guide commission: **15%** of booking total.
- Host commission: **18%** of booking total.

Rates may vary by subscription tier and can be changed with prior notice.

## Subscription tiers (sellers)
- Sellers may optionally subscribe to a tier (e.g., Pro/Elite) that reduces commission and may include additional benefits.
- Subscription fees are billed monthly via Stripe.
- If a subscription payment fails, the seller may revert to the Free tier and its commission.

## Payouts
- Payouts are sent to sellers after the booking is confirmed and any applicable refund window has passed.
- Refunds/chargebacks may reduce or reverse a payout.

## Taxes
- Sellers are responsible for their own tax reporting.

## Cancellations & refunds
- Refund policy may be set per listing and must be visible prior to purchase.
- Platform may withhold funds pending dispute resolution.
