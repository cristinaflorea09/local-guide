# Legal Compliance Checklist (Romania + EU) — Marketplace Model

This is a practical checklist for operating LocalGuide as a marketplace / intermediary (not a travel agency).

## 1) Platform positioning
- State clearly in-app and on the website: the platform is an intermediary connecting users with independent guides/hosts.
- Guides/hosts are independent providers and are responsible for the experience, safety, permits, and compliance.

## 2) Required legal documents (EN + RO)
- Terms & Conditions (traveler)
- Terms for Guides/Hosts (seller terms)
- Intermediary Contract (platform <-> seller)
- Privacy Policy (GDPR)
- Cancellation & Refund Policy (platform rules + per-listing policy)
- Cookie Policy (if you have a website)

## 3) Seller onboarding (Romania)
- Collect legal business details for sellers:
  - Business type (PFA/SRL)
  - Registration / CUI / VAT (if applicable)
  - Address
  - Upload certificate of registration
- Make sellers confirm they have the right to provide the service and hold any required authorizations.

## 4) Consumer protection
- Show before purchase:
  - total price, currency, what is included/excluded
  - cancellation rules for that listing
  - provider identity (name/business)
- Provide customer support contact and complaint handling.

## 5) GDPR / privacy
- Have a GDPR-compliant Privacy Policy.
- Collect only necessary personal data.
- Provide account deletion request path.
- Ensure lawful basis for processing, retention periods, and data subject rights.

## 6) Payments (marketplace)
- Use Stripe Connect Express.
- Disclose that payments are processed by Stripe.
- Clarify the fee/commission charged by the platform.
- Ensure payout timing is disclosed (payout after completion).

## 7) VAT / tax
- Clarify whether prices include VAT and who is the merchant of record.
- For marketplace model, the seller typically accounts for VAT on their service; platform accounts for VAT on platform fees/subscriptions.
- Keep transaction records (amount, fee, payout, seller business details) for reporting.

## 8) Safety and liability
- Add disclaimers and risk acknowledgements where relevant.
- Require sellers to comply with local laws, safety rules, and insurance where appropriate.

## 9) App Store / Google Play
- Ensure legal documents are accessible in-app before account creation and from settings.
- Provide contact and company identification.

Important: This checklist is not legal advice. Get counsel for final texts, VAT position, and any regulated-tourism questions.
